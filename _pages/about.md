I'm a fourth year undergraduate student from [School of Data Science](https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn/), [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/) (CUHK-Shenzhen), majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. My research interest includes the reliability and robustness of AI-based systems, large language models and multi-modal models.

I will begin my Ph.D. study at CUHK-Shenzhen in August 2024, and I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. HE Pinjia](https://pinjiahe.github.io/).
